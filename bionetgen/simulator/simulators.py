def sim_getter(model_file=None, model_str=None, sim_type="libRR"):
    """
    Convenience function to get a simulator object of a specific type.
    Allows you to pull a simulator object given a model file path.

    Note: This likely needs to be refactored but for now it works.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_file : str, optional
        The path to the model file, at the moment only BNGL is expected
        but this can change in the future.
    model_str : str, optional
        Instead of the path to the model you can also supply the model
        string instead.
    sim_type : str, optional
        The name of the type of simulator object to get. At the moment only
        libRoadRunner type simulators are allowed. This will get updated
        as differenty types of simulators are added.

    Returns
    -------
    BNGSimulator
        A simulator object with an API that's supposed to be agnostic to the
        underlying simulator it's running.

    The generic simulator interface to all BNG simulators.

    type.
